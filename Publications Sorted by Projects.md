## Bayesian Lasso Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) 

​							 							

##### 1. Partial Factor Analysis

**Participated in a project which proposed a partial factor analysis method between CFA and exploratory factor analysis. This project was published on Pyschological Methods. I was responsible for the simulation studies in the revision which was appraised as comprehensive by two reviewers [[See the Review Comments]](https://zhanglj37.github.io/blog_200409_PMparticipation.html) **

**Presented two talks about Bayesian Lasso Factor Analysis Models.	**					 							

##### 2. Bayesian Model Modification in CFA

**I built an R package which extent Bayesian Lasso CFA to a model modification method. I’am writing a paper to introducing this method and will give a Talk in the International Meeting of the Psychometric Society.**
