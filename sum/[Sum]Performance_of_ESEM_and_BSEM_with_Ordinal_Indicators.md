## Background

Limitations of **independent cluster model (ICM)** where each item loads on only one factor (McDonald, 1985): over- restrictive, may not adequately represent substantive theories, yields poor model-data fit, and results in biased parameter estimates (e.g., inflated factor covariance estimates, distorted path coefficient estimates; Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009; Marsh, Liem, Martin, Morin, & Nagengast, 2011).

Solution: ESEM and BSEM



in education and psychology, more than 80% of the data present some degrees of non-normality largely due to artificial categorization of survey responses (Micceri, 1989). 



How to deal with ordered categorical data: assume that there are underlying continuous variable for the observed ordered categorical variables

Two model indeterminacies of this model:

- One is from the covariance structure as confronted in linear SEMs: some elements in the factor loading matrix, factor covariance matrix, and residual covariance matrix have to be appropriately fixed to preassigned values.
- The other indeterminacy comes from the unknown metrics of continuous underlying variables: fix the scale factor / fix the residual variance
- 

Frequentist Estimation methods for ordinal data

- MLR: treats categorical variables as continuous

- weighted least squares (WLS), diagonally WLS (DWLS), unweighted least squares (ULS): considers data as ordinal and analyzes the model utilizing the polychoric correlation matrix and thresholds

- The DWLS with mean- and variance- adjustment (WLSMV) has been shown superior to robust ML and DWLS with other corrections for analyzing ordered catego- rical data (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2010).



The EFA part of ESEM

- First, an initial orthogonal solution is estimated based on the correlation matrix among indicators. 
- Second, the initial solution can be rotated using a rotation method to obtain a parsimonious loading matrix $Λ_e$ to simplify interpretations. 

## Highlight in the simulation study

The reason for choosing this structural equation model was based on empirical study.

Four categorical distributions were generated by applying different sets of thresholds to the underlying normally dis- tributed continuous data: (1) symmetric thresholds, (2) mod- erately asymmetric thresholds, (3) extremely asymmetric thresholds, and (4) heterogeneous thresholds across indicators. 

Prior variance: 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03

If inadmissible solutions occurred (did not converge and/or provided out-of-bound estimates), we excluded those from further analysis, and analyzed additional datasets until 500 admissible replications were obtained for each condition.



Results

The percentage of inadmissible solutions for BSEM was found less than ESEM

PPp test rejects a model less often than the chi-square test (Muthén & Asparouhov, 2012).

ANOVAs showed that three factors had salient influences on the relative bias of Structural coefficients and primary loadings: the size of cross-loadings, estimation method, number of cross-loadings, and the interaction between the estimation method and the size of cross-loadings. 

ESEM resulted in smaller aggregated RBs and RMSEs of factor correlations (varied from 3.82% to 30.05% for RBs and from .07 to .11 for RMSEs) than BSEMs (varied from 12.87% to 114.73% for RBs and from .08 to .35 for RMSEs). However, the difference in the RB and RMSE between ESEM and BSEMs tended to increase when the cross-loadings were larger (i.e., .30).

The RB of cross-loadings in ESEM decreased when the number of cross-loadings decreased and the sample size reduced. This is different from BSEM for which the RB decreased as the sample size increased. 



## Discussion

ESEM may be prioritized over BSEM when sample sizes were large, distributions of ordinal indicators were symmetric or moderately asymmetric, and cross-loadings were non-ignorable. When sample sizes were relatively small, we recommend using one approach to complement the other. 

For BSEM, a sensitivity test is recommended to evaluate the impact of various prior choices on the estimation outcomes.

Future research directions could focus on improving the model estimation and examining the more recent model fit measures. 



## My Thoughts

EFA ---> E-step in the partial CFA --> The CFA part of BSEM --> CFA

The performance of the E-step in the partial CFA in estimating the structural coefficients should be test and compared with BSEM and ESEM.



BSEM produced more bias than ESEM is as expected since BSEM used the ridge regularization method which sacrifices accuracy for generalizability.

BSEM can be more exploratory in the structural model than the ESEM (the structural model part of SEM can be advanced?)



The cutoff value of ppp is controversial. 

The Bayesian adaptive CFI, TLI should be compared with ppp.
