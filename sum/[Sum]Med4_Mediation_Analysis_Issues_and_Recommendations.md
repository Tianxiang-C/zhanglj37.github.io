**Importance of mediation analysis**

Mediational designs are at the heart of social science and business research, often referred to as ‘vital to theory development’ 

mediation is typically the standard technique and procedure to test theories in order to understand the causal relationship 

**Literature review**

Wood et al. (2008) reviewed five top management journals: 409 studies that tested mediational relationships 

Pieters (2017): majority of empirical articles in the Journal of Consumer Research used mediation analysis 

Rungtusanatham, Miller, and Boyer (2014) reviewed supply chain management articles which were published between 2008 and 2011 and found that supply chain management literature was/is increasingly interested in mediation effects.

**Limitations of Baron & Kenny's (1986) approach**

1) low statistical power, 2) not directly testing the significance of a specific indirect effect, 3) neither quantifying the magnitude of the mediation effect, nor accommodating models with inconsistent mediation (Hayes, 2009; MacKinnon, 2000; MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffmann, West, & Sheets, 2002; Rungtusanatham et al., 2014). 

Researchers should follow Preacher and Hayes’s (2004, 2008) approach and bootstrap the sampling distribution of the indirect effect.  

**Complete (full) vs Partial mediation**

Contemporary literature on mediation advocates that complete (also called full) and partial mediation concepts **have** **little value and should be abandoned** (Hayes, 2013; Hayes & Rockwood, 2016; Rucker et al., 2011).  

Full mediation implies that a researcher has completely explained the process by which X influences Y and no additional research is needed to search for further mediators (Hayes & Rockwood, 2016). 

The reality is that to claim full mediation, one would have to have confidently measured all possible mediators and suppressors without error. Nevertheless, measuring variables without error in social science and business research is practically impossible.
