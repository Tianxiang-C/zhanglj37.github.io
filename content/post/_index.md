> 终即始，黑夜之后必有黎明，大洋之下另有深渊。 -- 爱默生


> Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth, that around every circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but every end is a beginning; there is always another dawn risen on mid-noon, and under every deep a lower deep opens.  -- Ralph Waldo Emerson
