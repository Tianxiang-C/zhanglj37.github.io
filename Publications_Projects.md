## Bayesian Lasso Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) 

​							 							

##### 1. Partial Confirmatory Approach to Scale Development 

- **Participated in a project which proposed a partial confirmatory approach between CFA and exploratory factor analysis. This project was accepted by Pyschological Methods. I was responsible for the simulation studies in the revision which was appraised as comprehensive by two reviewers [[See the Review Comments]](https://zhanglj37.github.io/blog_200409_PMparticipation.html) **			 							

##### 2. Bayesian Model Modification in CFA

- **Built an R package which extent Bayesian Lasso CFA to a model modification method. **

##### 3. Comparison Between Effect Size, *p*-value, and Credible Interval in Variable Selection
